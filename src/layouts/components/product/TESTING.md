# Product Card Customization Testing Guide

## Issue Fixed: Dropdown Redirect Problem

### Problem Description
Users were being redirected to the product detail page when interacting with dropdown menus for Oil Type, Garlic Variant, or Weight selections on product cards.

### Root Cause
The product title Link component had `className="after:absolute after:inset-0"` which created an invisible overlay covering the entire card area, intercepting all click events including dropdown interactions.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Event Handling Fixes
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to all dropdown event handlers
- Added `onClick` and `onMouseDown` event handlers to prevent event bubbling
- Added `z-index: 30` to customization options containers to ensure they're above the link overlay

#### 2. Event Handlers Added
```typescript
// Prevent event bubbling to avoid triggering the product link
const handleDropdownClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
};

const handleDropdownMouseDown = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
};
```

#### 3. Applied to All Interactive Elements
- **Button options** (2-3 values): `onClick` with `e.stopPropagation()`
- **Dropdown options** (4+ values): `onClick`, `onMouseDown`, and `onChange` with `e.stopPropagation()`
- **Container divs**: `onClick={handleDropdownClick}` to catch any missed events

### Testing Checklist

#### ✅ Card View (CustomizableProductCard.tsx)
- [ ] Clicking Oil Type dropdown doesn't redirect to product page
- [ ] Clicking Garlic Variant dropdown doesn't redirect to product page  
- [ ] Clicking Weight dropdown doesn't redirect to product page
- [ ] Price updates dynamically when options are changed
- [ ] Product title link still works when clicked directly
- [ ] Add to Cart button still works correctly

#### ✅ List View (CustomizableProductListItem.tsx)
- [ ] Clicking any dropdown doesn't redirect to product page
- [ ] Price updates dynamically when options are changed
- [ ] Product title link still works when clicked directly
- [ ] Add to Cart button still works correctly

#### ✅ Debug Logging
- [ ] Console shows "Option changed: [OptionName] = [Value]" when dropdowns are used
- [ ] No console errors when interacting with dropdowns

### Expected Behavior
1. **Dropdown Interaction**: Clicking on any dropdown should open the dropdown menu without redirecting
2. **Price Updates**: Selecting different options should immediately update the displayed price
3. **Product Link**: Clicking on the product title should still navigate to the product detail page
4. **Add to Cart**: The Add to Cart button should work with the selected variant

### Browser Testing
Test in the following browsers:
- [ ] Chrome
- [ ] Firefox  
- [ ] Safari

### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Touch interactions work correctly on mobile devices
- [ ] Dropdowns are easily accessible on small screens
- [ ] No accidental redirects when scrolling or touching

### Performance
- [ ] No noticeable delay when changing options
- [ ] Price updates are instant
- [ ] No memory leaks from event handlers
